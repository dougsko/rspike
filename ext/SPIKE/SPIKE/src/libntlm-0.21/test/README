Dumper is a simple command line utility to display in readable
format base64 NTLM messages.  Given a base64 NTLM challenge, a
username and a password, it will optionally generate and
display a response message.  

Note that there are multiple correct response messages message
depending on what order the string data is placed at the end of
the frame. There is no required order. Dumper should always
generate the string data in the same order (and thus identical
base64 responses), even on different architectures.

It's possible that another application will generate a
different but also correct response message.

Run "dumper -?" for help.

Someday I'll write more documentation...
