New Version!

New version with lots of new code from jmccown@trusecure.com, Renaud Deraison and Pasi Eronen (big rewrite of major code blocks - he actually went and read the spec instead of doing everything blind :>) has made dcetest into a decent replacement for rpcdump! Thanks everyone!

This program is "dcetest" - basically a reproduction of rpcdump from microsoft,
but without the use of any dce libraries or API of any sort. It should be
fairly easy to use and understand, but if you have any problems, please
send them to daitel@atstake.com.
