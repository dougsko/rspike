This is a ruby wrapper for the SPIKE fuzzer API.

To build, make sure you're using gcc-3.4, then type:

  rake make

You will then need to either put ext/SPIKE/SPIKE/src/libdlrpc.so in
/usr/lib/ or export LD_LIBRARY_PATH to ext/SPIKE/SPIKE/src/ so that that
library can be found.  If you want to just install the lib, you can do
a:

  sudo rake lib_install
