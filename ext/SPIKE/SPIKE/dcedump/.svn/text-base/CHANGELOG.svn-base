This is the Changelog for dcetest.c

V 1.2 

jmccown sent in a patch that adds a nice debugging dump (if DEBUG is defined) and properly parses ncan_http and a few other formats I missed the first time around!

Also Renaud Deraison sent in some fixes so we properly recognize a few other packet types.

Thanks to all!
